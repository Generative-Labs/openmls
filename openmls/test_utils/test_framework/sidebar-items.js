It contains the state of all clients, as well as the global `KeyStore` containing the clients’ `CredentialBundles`. The `waiting_for_welcome` field acts as a temporary store for `KeyPackage`s that are used to add new members to groups. Note, that the `ManagedTestSetup` can only be initialized with a fixed number of clients and that `create_clients` has to be called before it can be otherwise used."]]});
